The "Bayesian survival analysis" is the main code for the analysis of the primary outcome event free survival of the HOVON 132 acute myeloid leukemia trial.

The "Bayesian analysis binary outcome" is the main code for the analysis of the secondary outcomes including CR, MRD, early deaths and adverse events.

The text files "Bayesian_survival_model" and "Bayesian_analysis_binary_outcome" contain the code for the model in jags.
